# Data Science Portfolio — Applied Analysis, Machine Learning, and Interpretation

This repository provides a curated overview of my data science portfolio, developed as part of a structured retraining into **data analysis and data science** after an established professional career.

The projects collected here emphasise **analytical judgement, careful documentation, and clarity of reasoning**. While I continue to deepen my machine learning experience, my work reflects a mature analytical approach: questioning assumptions, documenting decisions, and interpreting results in context rather than optimising blindly for performance.

Together, these projects demonstrate how I approach real analytical problems — thoughtfully, transparently, and with an awareness of how technical outputs are ultimately used by people and organisations.

## How to navigate this portfolio

Each project lives in its own repository and includes a **fully documented README** describing:

- the analytical or modelling task  
- the approach taken and decisions made  
- key findings and limitations  
- tools and techniques used  

Some projects also include **reviewer feedback**, where available, to provide external perspective on code quality, structure, and interpretation.

If you are short on time, I recommend starting with:

- **US Arrests — PCA and Unsupervised Clustering**  
  A strong example of analytical reasoning, interpretation, and unsupervised learning.
  🔗 https://github.com/SarennahL-C/pf-USarrests
- **Titanic — EDA, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Models**  
  Demonstrates progression from exploratory analysis to increasingly sophisticated supervised models.
  🔗 https://github.com/SarennahL-C/pf-titanic
- **Telco Customer Churn — Supervised Machine Learning**  
  A realistic end-to-end modelling workflow with attention to business context and evaluation metrics.

## How I work

Across projects, I prioritise:

- **Analytical judgement**  
  Understanding whether a method is appropriate before applying it.
- **Documentation and clarity**  
  Making reasoning, assumptions, and limitations explicit.
- **Interpretability**  
  Explaining *why* results appear, not just *what* they are.
- **Real-world context**  
  Considering how outputs would be used by stakeholders.

My machine learning skills are developing iteratively, but they are grounded in a broader analytical mindset shaped by experience, communication, and problem framing.

## Tools & techniques

Across the portfolio, tools include:

- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- Data visualisation (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Supervised and unsupervised machine learning
- Neural networks (PyTorch, TensorFlow / Keras)
- Natural language processing (spaCy, TextBlob)
- SQL and relational database design
- Jupyter Notebook workflows

Each project includes a `requirements.txt` file listing project-specific dependencies.

## About this portfolio

This portfolio reflects a transition into data-focused roles informed by long-standing professional experience. It is designed to demonstrate not just technical capability, but **how I think, document, and communicate as an analyst**.

I continue to expand and refine this work as my experience grows.
