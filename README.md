# Data Science Portfolio — Applied Analysis, Machine Learning, and Interpretation

This repository provides a curated overview of my data science portfolio, developed as part of a structured retraining into **data analysis and data science** after an established professional career.

The projects collected here emphasise **analytical judgement, careful documentation, and clarity of reasoning**. While I continue to deepen my machine learning experience, my work reflects a mature analytical approach: questioning assumptions, documenting decisions, and interpreting results in context rather than optimising blindly for performance.

Together, these projects demonstrate how I approach real analytical problems — thoughtfully, transparently, and with an awareness of how technical outputs are ultimately used by people and organisations.

## How to navigate this portfolio

Each project lives in its own repository and includes a **fully documented README** describing:

- the analytical or modelling task  
- the approach taken and decisions made  
- key findings and limitations  
- tools and techniques used  

Some projects also include **reviewer feedback**, where available, to provide external perspective on code quality, structure, and interpretation.

If you are short on time, I recommend starting with:

- **US Arrests — PCA and Unsupervised Clustering**  
  A strong example of analytical reasoning, interpretation, and unsupervised learning.
- **Titanic — EDA, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Models**  
  Demonstrates progression from exploratory analysis to increasingly sophisticated supervised models.
- **Telco Customer Churn — Supervised Machine Learning**  
  A realistic end-to-end modelling workflow with attention to business context and evaluation metrics.

## Portfolio structure

Projects are grouped broadly by analytical focus. Many span more than one category.

---

## Exploratory & Statistical Analysis

Projects focused on data understanding, structure, and interpretation.

- **Automobiles — Exploratory Data Analysis**  
  Executive fleet analysis combining data cleaning, visualisation, and insight generation.
- **Diabetes Regression Analysis**  
  Linear regression with careful consideration of feature relevance and sex-specific effects.
- **Ames Housing — Linear Regression Modelling**  
  Regression diagnostics, model revision based on feedback, and reusable code design.
- **US Arrests — PCA and Unsupervised Clustering**  
  Dimensionality reduction and clustering with emphasis on interpretability and limitations.

---

## Supervised Machine Learning

Projects applying classification and regression models with attention to evaluation and overfitting.

- **Titanic — Survival Modelling**  
  EDA followed by decision tree and random forest classifiers.
- **Telco Customer Churn**  
  Logistic regression and random forest models with class imbalance handling.
- **Iris — Logistic Regression**  
  Binary and multiclass classification with manual metric calculation.
- **Fashion MNIST — Neural Network Classification**  
  PyTorch MLP implementation with confusion matrix analysis.

---

## Unsupervised Learning

Projects exploring structure without labelled outcomes.

- **US Arrests — PCA and Clustering**  
- **Iris — PCA and Unsupervised Clustering**  
- **Country Development Classification — K-Means Clustering**  

These projects emphasise interpretation, validation of assumptions, and understanding what unsupervised methods can — and cannot — reveal.

---

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Text-based projects applying both classical and neural NLP techniques.

- **Shakespeare Text Generation — RNN**  
  Character-level text generation and discussion of architectural limitations.
- **Slogan Generation and Industry Classification**  
  Neural networks for text generation and classification, with modular design.
- **Movie Recommendation System — Semantic Similarity**  
  Content-based recommendation using vector similarity.
- **Amazon Product Reviews — Sentiment Analysis**  
  Polarity-based sentiment analysis and theme identification at scale.

---

## Databases & SQL

- **Ebookstore — SQL Inventory System**  
  A menu-driven Python application using SQLite, demonstrating practical database design and query logic beyond isolated SQL statements.

---

## How I work

Across projects, I prioritise:

- **Analytical judgement**  
  Understanding whether a method is appropriate before applying it.
- **Documentation and clarity**  
  Making reasoning, assumptions, and limitations explicit.
- **Interpretability**  
  Explaining *why* results appear, not just *what* they are.
- **Real-world context**  
  Considering how outputs would be used by stakeholders.

My machine learning skills are developing iteratively, but they are grounded in a broader analytical mindset shaped by experience, communication, and problem framing.

---

## Tools & techniques

Across the portfolio, tools include:

- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- Data visualisation (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Supervised and unsupervised machine learning
- Neural networks (PyTorch, TensorFlow / Keras)
- Natural language processing (spaCy, TextBlob)
- SQL and relational database design
- Jupyter Notebook workflows

Each project includes a `requirements.txt` file listing project-specific dependencies.

## About this portfolio

This portfolio reflects a transition into data-focused roles informed by long-standing professional experience. It is designed to demonstrate not just technical capability, but **how I think, document, and communicate as an analyst**.

I continue to expand and refine this work as my experience grows.
